## How to Freelance With Us?

### How to Start

Have an account with a good reputation 
in [GitHub](https://www.github.com) and 
[StackOverflow](https://wwww.stackoverflow.com).

Complete a test task, but joining one of our free projects and contributing with
at least five successful pull requests:
[Cactoos](https://github.com/yegor256/cactoos) or
[Takes](https://github.com/yegor256/takes).

Send us your CV by email to [team@cqfn.org](mailto:team@cqfn.org)
and mention your hourly rate in USD.

Pass a quick interview with one of our tech leaders.

Once the results of the test task and the interview are evaluated,
you will be invited to start working with tasks.

### How to Work

Get a task from us in GitHub: you will be assigned to an issue.

Complete the task and make sure the issue is closed:
if the issue is not closed (no matter why), the task 
is not done and will not be paid.

Once the issue is closed, email us the full URL of the issue
and we will release the payment.

### How to Get Paid

We use billing platform Solar-Staff to process payments.

First, create an account at [Solar-Staff](https://solar-staff.com/)
and provide necessary personal details: passport copy, address, phone number,
bank details.

In addition to a GitHub issue, you will get a task in Solar-Staff, 
where a fixed budget in RUB will be assigned.

At any moment you can request funds withdrawal. Currently available
currencies are RUB, USD, and EUR. A withdrawal in any other currency
is not supported by Solar-Staff.

When you withdraw in USD or EUR, an [exchange rate](https://www.cbr.ru/eng/currency_base/daily/)
of the Bank of Russia will be applied.
A withdrawal fee of 1.5% will be deducted from your withdrawal amount.

If you withdraw less than $50/€50/1000₽, there will be an extra 
$2/€2/100₽ fee deducted accordingly.
