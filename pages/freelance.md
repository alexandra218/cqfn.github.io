## How to Freelance With Us?

Have an account with a good reputation 
in [GitHub](https://www.github.com) and 
[StackOverflow](https://wwww.stackoverflow.com).

Join one of our free projects and contribute with
at least ten successful pull requests:
[Cactoos](https://github.com/yegor256/cactoos) or
[Takes](https://github.com/yegor256/takes).

Send us your CV by email to [team@cqfn.org](mailto:team@cqfn.org)
and mention your hourly rate in USD.

Pass a quick interview with one of our tech leaders.

Create an account at [Solar-Staff](https://solar-staff.com/)
and provide necessary personal details: passport copy, address, phone number,
bank details.

Get a task from us in GitHub: you will be assigned to an issue.

You will also get a task in Solar-Staff, 
where a fixed budget in RUB will be assigned.
We will use
the current USD-to-RUB [exchange rate](https://www.cbr.ru/eng/currency_base/daily/)
of the Bank of Russia.

Complete the task and make sure the issue is closed:
if the issue is not closed (no matter why), the task 
is not done and will not be paid.

Once the issue is closed, email us the full URL of the issue
and we will release the payment in Solar-Staff.

At any moment of time you can request funds withdrawal from
Solar-Staff: 1.5% will be deducted from your withdrawal amount
and the money will be sent to you either in USD, EUR, or RUB, using
the exchange rate of the Bank of Russia. If you withdraw less than $100,
there will be a $40 fee deducted.
