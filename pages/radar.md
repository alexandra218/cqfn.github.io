## [HPVM v1.0 released](https://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2021-April/149693.html)

9-Apr-2021: 
Heterogeneous computing refers to systems that use more than one 
kind of processor or cores.
Many chip manufacturers offer their solutions, in particular, for 
the binding of the CPU and neuroprocessor. Disadvantages of 
this approach are the proprietary source code of compilers and closed 
interfaces, which do not allow to improve the quality 
of such applications, to implement code analyzers and autofixers. 
The new HPVM compiler is an attempt to find an effective standardized common solution. 
This [solution](https://publish.illinois.edu/hpvm-project/) positioning itself 
as a more low-level and flexible approach than competitive frameworks such OpenCL.
We presume that the release of HPVM backend will encourage the development of
high-performance specified programming languages related to 
heterogeneous computing such as graphics processing, neural 
algorithms, or neural networks.
