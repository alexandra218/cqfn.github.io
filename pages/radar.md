## [Google is saving $1 billion per year as a result of employees working from home](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-28/google-is-saving-over-1-billion-a-year-by-working-from-home)

28-Apr-2021:
According to the 2020 annual report, it is more than 0.5% of
[revenue](https://www.statista.com/statistics/266206/googles-annual-global-revenue/) 
and more than 2.5% of net income. Another fact: despite the pandemic, Google shows 
[stable financial growth](https://www.statista.com/statistics/513049/alphabet-annual-global-income/),
even higher than in previous years. We believe that such positive results show us
that even in economic degradation it is possible to continue productive developments
and research. Remote work must not be a problem for us. To reduce the impact of 
external negative processes such as pandemic on business, we must focus significantly
more on distributed development methods, such as open software and contracts with
universities, external researchers, freelancers. Code Quality Foundation presumes that 
the discipline of writing quality source code is a cornerstone in such a method of research.
Completely proprietary research will inevitably fail in current realities.

## [HPVM v1.0 released](https://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2021-April/149693.html)

9-Apr-2021: 
Heterogeneous computing refers to systems that use more than one 
kind of processor or cores.
Many chip manufacturers offer their solutions, in particular, for 
the binding of the CPU and neuroprocessor. Disadvantages of 
this approach are the proprietary source code of compilers and closed 
interfaces, which do not allow to improve the quality 
of such applications, to implement code analyzers and autofixers. 
The new HPVM compiler is an attempt to find an effective standardized common solution. 
This [solution](https://publish.illinois.edu/hpvm-project/) positioning itself 
as a more low-level and flexible approach than competitive frameworks such OpenCL.
We presume that the release of HPVM backend will encourage the development of
high-performance specified programming languages related to 
heterogeneous computing such as graphics processing, neural 
algorithms, or neural networks.
