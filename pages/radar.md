## [Kickstarting AI for Code: Introducing IBMâ€™s Project CodeNet](https://research.ibm.com/blog/codenet-ai-for-code)
12-May-2021:
Declared that [the collection](https://developer.ibm.com/technologies/artificial-intelligence/data/project-codenet/)
includes 14 million code examples that solve 4053 typical programming problems.
This is 8 GB of archived data.
We presume that the problem of improving the quality of source codes will be constantly and highly relevant.
Also we believe that the active introduction of machine learning technologies in the such problematic testifies
to the successful results of such research, and consequently, will lead to a fast increase in the share of
artificial intelligence in the source codes analysis compared to static methods.


## [QEMU version 6.0.0 released](https://www.qemu.org/2021/04/30/qemu-6-0-0/)

30-Apr-2021:
The undoubted advantage of QEMU is that it allows emulating any architecture on any type of machine
(or server). The new 6 major version offers [a significant number](https://wiki.qemu.org/ChangeLog/6.0) 
of changes to support modern platforms.
In our opinion, the tool is a good basis for more in-depth testing of the quality and functionality
of the source code, for example for building CI/CD systems that simultaneously support several hardware
architectures. As a result, it will simplify the development of system software, compilers,
virtual machines, and other platform-dependent code.


## [HPVM v1.0 released](https://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2021-April/149693.html)

9-Apr-2021: 
Heterogeneous computing refers to systems that use more than one 
kind of processor or cores.
Many chip manufacturers offer their solutions, in particular, for 
the binding of the CPU and neuroprocessor. Disadvantages of 
this approach are the proprietary source code of compilers and closed 
interfaces, which do not allow to improve the quality 
of such applications, to implement code analyzers and autofixers. 
The new HPVM compiler is an attempt to find an effective standardized common solution. 
This [solution](https://publish.illinois.edu/hpvm-project/) positioning itself 
as a more low-level and flexible approach than competitive frameworks such OpenCL.
We presume that the release of HPVM backend will encourage the development of
high-performance specified programming languages related to 
heterogeneous computing such as graphics processing, neural 
algorithms, or neural networks.
